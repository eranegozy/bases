Worksheets and Meet Problems for Math League Bases

## Overview

The content for these worksheets is written in HTML, using MathJax for mathematical typography. The primary innovation here is to let the javascript code do the work of computing answers to the bases problems. There is a mini scripting language used throughout the HTML pages that can set up problems and automatically calculate solutions.

To view a page, simply open it up in a browser (I use Chrome), though others should work fine.

Clicking anywhere on the page automatically converts it into the solutions form of the page.

To generate a worksheet and the corresponding answer sheet, open up the page, print to PDF, click anywhere, and print to PDF again.

## Scripting Language

TODO - describe the scripting language system
